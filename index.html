        <h1>Ternary To Statement Converter (TTSC)</h1>
        <p>
            This tool was created with the purpose of assisting in reverse-engineering javascript code. More specifically the "decompression" of ternaries to statements.
        </p>
        <p>
            To decrease the size of any javascript code, it is compressed using various techniques. The resulting code still works like the original, but less packets are needed to transmit it in a network. This leads to a more difficult time of understanding the
            script though, as there is no indentation and no brackets.
        </p>

        <p>
            This tool/function currently allows the accurate translation of nested and non-nested ternaries to statements. It even works with variables and return statements. There is only one thing which needs to be added: resolving brackets in a ternary statement.
